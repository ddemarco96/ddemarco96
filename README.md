ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan (@ddemarco96)

I build products aimting to make the world a better place and offer consulting services for teams and individuals with similar goals. My background is in the intersection between behavior science and software engineering. Iâ€™m a researcher and an engineer, meaning Iâ€™m passionate about understanding the world but also constantly trying to debug it.
