ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan (@ddemarco96)

I build products with the aim of making the world a better place and offer consulting services for teams and individuals with similar goals. My background is in the intersection between behavior science and software engineering. I'm a researcher with a passion for improvement, whether it's myself, the projects I work on, or the world around me.

- ðŸ¤– I work primarily with python and django but dabble in a few other languages as well.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently paving the way for digital mental health at https://apoth.app 
- ðŸ“« You can drop me an [email](mailto:dylan@apoth.app), send me a message on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/dylan-demarco/), or [grab a virtual coffee with me](https://dotcal.co/dd/crisplettuce-15)
