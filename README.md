ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan (@ddemarco96)

I build products to make the world a better place and offer consulting/coaching services for teams and individuals with similar goals. My background is in the intersection between behavior science and software engineering. Iâ€™m a researcher and an engineer, meaning Iâ€™m passionate about understanding the world but also constantly trying to debug it.

- ðŸ¤– I work primarily with python and django but dabble in a few other languages as well.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently paving the way for digital mental health at https://apoth.health 
- ðŸ“« You can drop me an [email](mailto:d.demarco996@gmail.com), send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dylan-demarco/).
